            Owning property can be a proud moment for any person. While most
            people look forward to owning the building on that property, the
            land offers many issues that any homeowner will have to face. One of
            those issues is having to determine what you own based on where your
            property is located. You’re going to find many things along your
            property line, ranging from fences to sheds. One of the most
            difficult objects to move is a tree. When it comes to a tree being
            on your property line, there are many laws that get in the way of
            the removal of that tree. This is when you should call a land
            surveyor to see what you can do to get rid of said tree.
          </p>
          <p className="article__desc">
            So the first real question is “who owns the tree”? When a tree is
            suspiciously close to your property line, it may be difficult to
            determine its exact location. The tree’s location is what will make
            its removal that much more difficult. It’s important that you locate
            the tree relative to where your property line is before you move
            forward with any removal.

            That’s where the surveyor gets involved. Before you can make a
            determination of whether or not you can trim or cut down the tree
            you first have to make a determination as to where the tree is
            located in reference to the property lines. A land surveyor has the
            knowledge to locate your property lines and also mark out where that
            line is on your property. Without the proper tools, locating your
            property lines can be almost impossible. Thanks to modern
            technology, a land surveyor can potentially survey your home and
            stake it out all in the same day.
          </p>
          <p className="article__desc">
            You may be wondering what a stake is when it comes to land
            surveying. This references a marker, typically an iron pin or a
            wooden stake. A surveyor will place these markers, or stakes, at
            property corners to indicate where the property lines are. The
            homeowner can then tie a string off at each stake to physically lay
            out where their property lines are. Another option would be to place
            markers along the property line in addition to the corners.
          </p>
          <p className="article__desc">
            Now that a land surveyor has located your property lines, you may be
            ready for trimming. Trimming the part of the tree that is on your
            property is legal but you can’t go onto your neighbor’s property.
            Also, cutting the tree down is illegal unless you have your
            neighbor’s consent or the tree is causing a hazard. And even then
            you would have to put the tree owner on notice that the tree is
            causing the hazard. Lastly, if the tree straddles the line then you
            both own it and if you can’t come to an agreement, then you would
            have to go to court.

            According to Title 18, Chapter 1, Section 18-129 of the New York
            City Administrative Code, it is illegal to remove, kill, or damage a
            street or park tree. Before removing any trees that are close to
            your property line, reach out to a land surveyor to help you
            determine where your property lines fall. Contact All County Land
